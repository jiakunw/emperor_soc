2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
167 out of 182 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: S_AXI_araddr[31:0], S_AXI_arready, S_AXI_arvalid, S_AXI_awaddr[31:0],
S_AXI_awready, S_AXI_awvalid, S_AXI_bready, S_AXI_bresp[1:0], S_AXI_bvalid,
S_AXI_rdata[31:0], S_AXI_rresp[1:0], S_AXI_wdata[31:0], debug_r_state[2:0],
debug_w_next_state[2:0], front_addr[15:0] (the first 15 of 22 listed).
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
167 out of 182 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: S_AXI_araddr[31:0], S_AXI_arready, S_AXI_arvalid, S_AXI_awaddr[31:0],
S_AXI_awready, S_AXI_awvalid, S_AXI_bready, S_AXI_bresp[1:0], S_AXI_bvalid,
S_AXI_rdata[31:0], S_AXI_rresp[1:0], S_AXI_wdata[31:0], debug_r_state[2:0],
debug_w_next_state[2:0], front_addr[15:0] (the first 15 of 22 listed).
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control/w_decode_error__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control/w_decode_error_reg_i_2/O, cell control/w_decode_error_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control/w_next_state_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control/w_next_state_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell control/w_next_state_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control/w_rd_done__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control/w_rd_done_reg_i_2/O, cell control/w_rd_done_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net control/w_slave_error__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin control/w_slave_error_reg_i_2/O, cell control/w_slave_error_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net emperor_gpio/w_next_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin emperor_gpio/FSM_onehot_w_next_state_reg[1]_i_2__1/O, cell emperor_gpio/FSM_onehot_w_next_state_reg[1]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net emperor_timer/w_next_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin emperor_timer/FSM_onehot_w_next_state_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell emperor_timer/FSM_onehot_w_next_state_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net emperor_uart/w_next_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin emperor_uart/FSM_onehot_w_next_state_reg[2]_i_2__0/O, cell emperor_uart/FSM_onehot_w_next_state_reg[2]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
